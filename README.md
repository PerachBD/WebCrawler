# WebCrawler
## What does WebCrawler do?
 Scrape the web according to:
  
 * The url to start scraping from.
  
 * The maximum depth to crawl down to from the start url.
  
 * The max number of pages for the entire scrape job.
  
 (Stop crawling a job when it reaches maxDepth or maxPages,
whichever comes first.)
  
## Architecture:

2. run comman "npm start" in activefence_challenge folder and in \activefence_challenge\src\client.

## For future expansion:
1. Save running time for overlapping scrape jobs
